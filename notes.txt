- implement:
    -- add state effects (are checked every time game updates)
    -- add optional "uses stack" option to triggers (decide what to do with damage triggers)
    -- separate trinkets from treasure in treasure discard
    -- disable activating passive items in client
    -- enable activation choice in client (if card has 2+ activated abilities)
    -- some effects need to distinct between different turns (add wrap_getTurnCounter, use CardData table to store last turn)
    -- make an actual md to see how to setup the project
    -- add game logs (perhaps in a different window)
    -- better card zoom
    -- add tapping all cards of dead player
    -- add dice modifiers
    -- add buying cards from the top of the treasure deck
    -- add visible rolls and attack to monsters
    -- implement monster effects
    -- implement effects that buff monsters
    -- add bonus effects to the monster deck
    -- add bad treasure
    -- change how gaining souls works
    -- add rooms
    -- think how to implement more complex cards (flipable cards, cards that turn into monsters)
    -- search for the reason of the attack-roll in stack (if it's still even present)
    -- change choice cards to store player's choice in CardData, dont forget to log the player's choice for other players
    -- figure out how to implement canceling effects
    -- add animations
    -- add sound
    -- better client ui
    -- use better library to reduce memory used for storing card images
    -- bonus souls
    -- the expansion heavily leans on the fact that non-monster cards can be attacked, think of implementing this in later stages
    -- card parser (?)
