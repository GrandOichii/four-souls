- sound:
    -- check stack, if it has a new trigger from a holy monster, play holy!.wav
    -- when new monster is added, if it's name is mom!, play one of the mom sound effects
    -- when money is added, play penny/nickel/dime pickup
    -- when playing special effects, play power up
    -- when new monster is added, if it's name is satan, play the satan sound effect

- old images:
    -- fly

- issues:
    -- when buying cards with curved horn effect and attacking again
    -- does callus save from evil twins effect
    -- shiny rock don't work
    -- shiny rock + more options
    -- bonus monster cards don't work exactly like the rules say - refilling
    -- text can't render $ in $?
    -- monster death triggers death trigger of monster behind it in it's pile

- implement:
    -- change how declaring attacks works (add attack button)
    -- change how monster data is managed (tie it to the CardWrapper)
    -- bartering: a special button, when pressed will present a choice to the player: select the player to barter with, select coin count, type in text with the favor. the receiving player can accept or decline, the returning message will contain a accepted(bool) and response(string)
    -- addListener(host, <owner id>, <card id>, <on what>, <check func name>, <cost func name>, <effect func name>, <uses stack>), returns listener id
    -- removeListener(host, <listener id>)
    -- add effect ordering
    -- add card ordering (in hand)
    -- change how guppy's hairball works (push effect on deal damage layers)
    -- add custom counters (egg counters mostly)
    -- remove killing players multiple times per turn (fixed?)
    -- add game logs (perhaps in a different window)
    -- better card zoom (perhaps in a different window)
    -- if a player gains +1 treasure due to rewards, and the card has a monster death trigger, the card is triggered immediately - decide whether to keep or not
    -- add rooms
    -- change choice cards to store player's choice in CardData, don't forget to log the player's choice for other players
    -- figure out how to implement canceling effects
    -- add multiple cube of meat cards

-- implementation issues:
    - Box!, Gold Key, The Duke of Flies - requires adding silent listener effects without any owners
    - Charmed * - don't know if their ability uses the stack
    - Gutted Fatty - have to implement attack button and their respectable effects
    - Host Hat, Lollypop - requires pushEffect function
    - Knight - don't know the correct way to implement
    - Remote Detonator, Emergency Meeting! - implement voting (with sussy amogus in mind)
    - Rib of Greed - figure out how to distinct from paying and abilities
    - Soul of Envy - add emitting soul_gain effects
    - The Dead Cat - add another effect, that describes the state of the card on creation
    - Ultra Pride, Monster Manual - add editing of attack pools (correctly!)
    - Whipper, Ring of the Snake - currently no way to know who declares an attack
    - Holy Mantle - death prevention, cancelling everything
    - Sibling Rivalry - ...
    - IBS - cancelling of abilities
    - Dead Weight - cancelling triggered abilties
    - Classic Roller - rolling multiple dice
    - Ball of Tumors, Bum-Bo! - leveling of cards
    - Strange Marble - weird loot play
    - The Real Left Hand - editing card values
    - Possession - using other players' abilities
    - Is You - copying card abilities
    - Bow and Arrow, * Proglottid - custom counters
    - Rusty Spoon - putting cards under the card
    - Pop Pop!, Blank Card - copying loot cards on stack
    - Trinity Shield - effect to narrow
    - Diplopia - copying passive items
    - Modeling Clay - copying items fully
    - Placebo - copying abilities on stack
    - The Shovel - targeting card in discard
    - Skeleton Key -= 
    CAN: headless horseman, parabite, pink eye, polycephalus, red candle, round worm

- bonus:
    -- add animations
    -- add sound
    -- better client ui
    -- use better library to reduce memory used for storing card images
    -- bonus souls
    -- the expansion heavily leans on the fact that non-monster cards can be attacked, think of implementing this in later stages
    -- card parser (?)
