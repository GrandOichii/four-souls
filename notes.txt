- sound:
    -- check stack, if it has a new trigger from a holy monster, play holy!.wav
    -- when new monster is added, if it's name is mom!, play one of the mom sound effects
    -- when money is added, play penny/nickel/dime pickup
    -- when playing special effects, play power up
    -- when new monster is added, if it's name is satan, play the satan sound effect

- old images:
    -- fly

- issues:
    -- when buying cards with curved horn effect and attacking again
    -- does callus save from evil twins effect
    -- shiny rock don't work
    -- shiny rock + more options
    -- bonus monster cards don't work exactly like the rules say - refilling

- implement:
    -- bartering: a special button, when pressed will present a choice to the player: select the player to barter with, select coin count, type in text with the favor. the receiving player can accept or decline, the returning message will contain a accepted(bool) and response(string)
    -- fix the record error
    -- move from name-based indexing to key indexing
    -- addListener(host, <owner id>, <card id>, <on what>, <check func name>, <cost func name>, <effect func name>, <uses stack>), returns listener id
    -- removeListener(host, <listener id>)
    -- add effect ordering
    -- add card ordering
    -- change how guppy's hairball works
    -- add custom counters (egg counters mostly)
    -- remove killing players multiple times per turn
    -- add game logs (perhaps in a different window)
    -- better card zoom ( perhaps in a different window )
    -- add attacking top of monster deck
    -- add bonus effects to the monster deck
    -- if a player gains +1 treasure due to rewards, and the card has a monster death trigger, the card is triggered immediately - decide whether to keep or not
    -- add rooms
    -- change choice cards to store player's choice in CardData, dont forget to log the player's choice for other players
    -- figure out how to implement canceling effects
    -- add multiple cube of meat cards

- bonus:
    -- add animations
    -- add sound
    -- better client ui
    -- use better library to reduce memory used for storing card images
    -- bonus souls
    -- the expansion heavily leans on the fact that non-monster cards can be attacked, think of implementing this in later stages
    -- card parser (?)
