- sound:
    -- check stack, if it has a new trigger from a holy monster, play holy!.wav
    -- when new monster is added, if it's name is mom!, play one of the mom sound effects
    -- when money is added, play penny/nickel/dime pickup
    -- when playing special effects, play power up
    -- when new monster is added, if it's name is satan, play the satan sound effect

- fix size:
    -- stars
    -- psy horf

- implement:
    -- when stealing item, call their "leave", then call their "enter", so that the effects know who the owner is
    -- add custom counters (egg counters mostly)
    -- remove killing players multiple times per turn
    -- add refilling to the stack
    -- add state effects (are checked every time game updates)
    -- separate trinkets from treasure in treasure discard
    -- enable activation choice in client (if card has 2+ activated abilities)
    -- some effects need to distinct between different turns (add wrap_getTurnCounter, use CardData table to store last turn)
    -- add game logs (perhaps in a different window)
    -- better card zoom ( perhaps in a different window )
    -- add tapping all cards of dead player
    -- add dice modifiers
    -- add buying cards from the top of the treasure deck
    -- add visible rolls and attack to monsters
    -- implement monster effects
    -- implement effects that buff monsters
    -- add bonus effects to the monster deck
    -- add bad treasure
    -- if a player gains +1 treasure due to rewards, and the card has a monster death trigger, the card is triggered immediately - decide whether to keep or not
    -- change how gaining souls works
    -- add rooms
    -- add better console argument parsing
    -- think how to implement more complex cards (flipable cards, cards that turn into monsters)
    -- search for the reason of the [declare_attack-roll] in stack (if it's still even present)
    -- change choice cards to store player's choice in CardData, dont forget to log the player's choice for other players
    -- figure out how to implement canceling effects
    -- add animations
    -- add sound
    -- better client ui
    -- use better library to reduce memory used for storing card images
    -- bonus souls
    -- the expansion heavily leans on the fact that non-monster cards can be attacked, think of implementing this in later stages
    -- card parser (?)
